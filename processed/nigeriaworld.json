details of about N400bn so far saved as a result of the removal of subsidy on Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) popularly called petrol.\u0094 The suit followed reports that the Federal Government has saved N400bn within the four weeks following the implementation of the removal of subsidy on petrol policy.\u0094 In the suit number FHC/L/CS/1514/2023 filed last week at the Federal High Court in Lagos, SERAP is seeking: \u0093an order of mandamus to direct and compel President Tinubu to publish details of spending of about N400 billion saved as a result of the removal of subsidy on petrol on 29 May, 2023.\u0094 SERAP is also seeking: \u0093an order of mandamus to direct and compel President Tinubu to provide details of the plans on how the savings from the removal of subsidy on petrol, including specific projects on which the funds would be spent.\u0094 SERAP is also seeking: \u0093an order of mandamus to compel President Tinubu to provide details of the mechanisms that have been put in place to ensure that the savings from the removal of subsidy on petrol are not diverted into private pockets.\u0094 In the suit, SERAP is arguing that: \u0093Nigerians have the right to know how the savings are spent.\nDisclosing the spending details of the savings would reduce the risks of corruption in the spending of the funds.\u0094 SERAP is arguing that, \u0093The Tinubu government has a legal obligation to ensure that the savings from the removal of subsidy on petrol are spent solely for the benefit of the 137 million poor Nigerians who are bearing the brunt of the removal.\u0094 SERAP is also arguing that, \u0093Opacity in the spending of the savings from subsidy removal would have negative impacts on the fundamental interests of the citizens and the public interest.\u0094 According to SERAP, \u0093the savings from subsidy removal may be embezzled, misappropriated or diverted into private pockets.\u0094 The suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers, Kolawole Oluwadare, Ms Adelanke Aremo, and Ms Valentina Adegoke, read in part: \u0093Transparency would increase public trust and confidence that these savings would be used to benefit Nigerians.\u0094 \u0093The Nigerian Constitution, 1999 [as amended], Freedom of Information Act, and the country\u0092s anti-corruption and human rights obligations rest on the principle that citizens should have access to information regarding their government\u0092s activities.\u0094 \u0093Prevention of corruption in the spending of savings from the removal of subsidy on petrol and preventing and addressing the challenges caused by the removal are serious and legitimate public interests.\u0094 \u0093The Tinubu government has a legal obligation to protect individuals against the threat posed to human rights by the removal of subsidy on petrol, and to effectively address the aftermath of subsidy removal.\u0094 \u0093Unless the government is compelled and directed to publish the spending details of the savings from the removal of subsidy on petrol, the removal will continue to undermine the rights of Nigerians, and increase their vulnerability to poverty.\u0094 \u0093The implementation of the National Social Safety Net Programme (NASSP) and spending on the programme have been mostly shrouded in secrecy.\u0094 \u0093Publishing the details of the spending of the N400bn and other savings from the removal of subsidy would also ensure that persons with public responsibilities are answerable to the people for the performance of their duties.\u0094 \u0093Transparency and accountability in the spending details of the N400bn saved as a result of the removal of subsidy on petrol, and on the spending of subsequent savings from the removal would mean that the savings can help poor Nigerians to overcome the effects of such removal.\u0094 \u0093It would also help to avoid a morally repugnant result of double jeopardy on poor and socially and economically vulnerable Nigerians.\u0094 \u0093The lack of transparency and accountability in the spending of savings from the removal of subsidy on petrol and the resulting human costs would directly threaten fundamental human rights that the government has an obligation to protect.\u0094 \u0093The Tinubu government has the legal obligations to address the effects of subsidy removal on the human rights of 137 million poor Nigerians, and to prevent and address some of the direst consequences that the removal may reap on human rights, especially given the disproportionate impact on these Nigerians.\u0094 \u0093The removal of subsidy on petrol continues to negatively and disproportionately affect poor Nigerians, undermining their right to adequate standard of living.\u0094 \u0093Many years of allegations of corruption and mismanagement in the spending of public funds
