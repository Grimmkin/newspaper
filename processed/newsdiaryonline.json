N400bn within the four weeks following the implementation of the removal of subsidy on petrol policy.\u201dIn the suit number FHC/L/CS/1514/2023 filed last week at the Federal High Court in Lagos, SERAP is seeking: \u201can order of mandamus to direct and compel President Tinubu to publish details of spending of about N400 billion saved as a result of the removal of subsidy on petrol on 29 May,

also arguing that, \u201cOpacity in the spending of the savings from subsidy removal would have negative impacts on the fundamental interests of the citizens and the public interest.\u201dAccording to

by the removal are serious and legitimate public interests.\u201d\u201cThe Tinubu government has a legal obligation to protect individuals against the threat posed to human rights by the removal of subsidy on petrol, and to effectively address the aftermath of subsidy removal.\u201d\u201cUnless the government is compelled and directed to publish the spending details of the savings from the removal of subsidy on petrol, the removal will continue to undermine the rights of Nigerians, and increase their vulnerability to poverty.\u201d\u201cThe implementation of the National Social Safety Net Programme (NASSP) and spending on the programme have been mostly shrouded in secrecy.\u201d\u201cPublishing the details of the spending of the N400bn and other savings from the removal of subsidy would also ensure that persons with public responsibilities are answerable to the people for the performance of their duties.\u201d\u201cTransparency and accountability in the spending details of the N400bn saved as a result of the removal of subsidy on petrol, and on the spending of subsequent savings from the removal would mean that the savings can help poor Nigerians to overcome the effects of such removal.\u201d\u201cIt would also help to avoid a morally repugnant result of double jeopardy on poor and socially and economically vulnerable Nigerians.\u201d\u201cThe lack of transparency and accountability in the spending of savings from the removal of subsidy on petrol and the resulting human costs would directly threaten fundamental human rights that the government has an obligation to protect.\u201d\u201cThe Tinubu government has the legal obligations to address the effects of subsidy removal on the human rights of 137 million poor Nigerians, and to prevent and address some of the direst consequences that the removal may reap on human rights, especially given the disproportionate impact on these Nigerians.\u201d\u201cThe removal of subsidy on petrol continues to negatively and

Lagos and Ogun states because of COVID-19.\u201dSERAP is also asking the Federal Government and CBN to: \u201cdisclose information on the details of implementation of the school feeding programme during the lockdown and closure of schools in several states where the programme is being implemented, including the number of children that have so far benefited from the programme and the names of the communities, since the lockdown and closure of schools, as well as the number of cooks engaged.\u201dIn two Freedom of Information (FoI) requests sent to Ms Sadia Umar-Farouk, Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disasters Management and Social Development, and Mr Godwin Emefiele, CBN governor, SERAP said: \u201cWe are seriously concerned that millions of the country\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable people have not benefited from the announced palliatives, donations, reported cash payments, cash transfers and other benefits.\u201dSERAP said: \u201cProviding socio-economic benefits to the country\u2019s poorest especially at this time of COVID-19 crisis is a matter of human rights, not charity.\nIt is also implicit in Nigerians\u2019 right to freely use their natural wealth and resources, which ought to be spent for the public good.\nEnsuring that relief funds and donations are used to provide much-needed benefits to beneficiaries is critical to keeping people alive, and addressing vulnerabilities and inequalities in the country.\u201dIn the FoI requests dated 4 April, 2020 and signed by SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, the organization said: \u201cProviding the information would help to address the concerns by many Nigerians regarding allegations of corruption and politicization in the distribution of benefits, improve public trust, and enhance the integrity of the entire processes and modes of distribution of reliefs/benefits to these Nigerians.\u201dThe FoI requests read, in part: \u201cRather than making physical cash payments to the country\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable people, we urge you to begin electronic cash transfers to all beneficiaries through individuals\u2019 Bank Verification Numbers (BVNs), already available through the banks.\nThis would be cost-effective at this time of crisis, provide immediate and significant benefits, as well as give individuals and families the freedom to spend the money on goods and services that best meet their particular needs.\u201d\u201cIf we have not heard from you within 7 days of the receipt and/or publication of the FoI requests, the Registered Trustees of SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions under the Freedom of Information Act to compel you to comply with our requests.\u201d\u201cNigerian authorities are locking down states without adequately making provisions for the access of the country\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable people to basic necessities of life like food, healthcare, and other basic needs during the duration of the lockdown, and to address the corrosive impacts of COVID-19 on these Nigerians.\u201d\u201cRather than sending relief materials to the country\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable people, which may be diverted and in any case, may not be what certain individuals and families may need, we urge you to focus more on urgently making electronic cash transfers to these Nigerians to determine by themselves how they wish to spend the money to meet their peculiar individuals\u2019 and families\u2019 needs.\u201d\u201cProviding direct, regular, and unconditional electronic cash transfers to the country\u2019s poorest and the most vulnerable people, including workers and pensioners that have not been paid for months is the best to stop the spread of COVID-19 in the country, and to save millions of Nigerians\u2019 lives.\nThe power to spend cash helps preserve a person\u2019s basic human dignity.\u201d\u201cWe urge you to refer to the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) and Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for prompt, thorough and transparent investigations of allegations of corruption in the distribution of relief funds and donations for COVID-19 and the politicization of the process for the distribution funds, as well as to urge the anti-corruption bodies to effectively prosecute any credible cases of corruption.\u201d\u201cWe are concerned that some 80 million of the country\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable people would be negatively affected by the lockdown and stay-at-home order without effective, transparent and direct socio-economic intervention funds, food, standard health care services, clean water, and other reliefs by the authorities.\u201d\u201cWe request you to provide us with copies of the National Social Investment Programme (NSIP"
