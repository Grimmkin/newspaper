removal on the human rights of 137 million poor Nigerians, and to prevent and address some of the direst consequences that the removal may reap on human rights, especially given the disproportionate

        "summary": "Fuel Marketers have asked the Federal Government to come out clean on its stands on fuel subsidy, as they insist that the government has quietly returned to subsidising the pump price of Premium Motor Spirit, popularly called petrol.\nWhile marketers fear that the amount being quietly spent as subsidy on petrol by the federal government is gradually mounting high due to current crude oil prices, they have asked the government to come clean on it.\nKekeocha maintained that the decision of the federal government to put a cap on petrol prices meant that subsidy on petrol had been reinstated.\nThe IPMAN official explained that although the rise in crude oil price would increase Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange earnings, the forex was being used to import refined products.\nThe rise in crude oil prices has both positive and negative effects on Nigeria."

        "summary": "Indications have emerged that oil marketers might be losing hope for local refining of fuel soon, as the 650,000 barrels per day Dangote Refinery is yet to commence any local production even after a promised deadline.\nThe situation has sent a not-too-good signal to the oil industry as stakeholders were much expectant, and hopefully, the start of local production by the facility would bring succour to Nigerians.\nA top source among the Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) confirmed this development, saying the NNPCL had indeed cut down importation with the hope of Dangote refinery pushing out some product last month.\nMeanwhile, amidst all this agitation, Dangote Refinery has remained mum over the issue, as officials of the Communications Department of the facility could not give any concrete explanation.\nBut a source at the refinery told The Punch that the management was unsure of when petrol refining would begin at the Ibeju-Lekki facility."
