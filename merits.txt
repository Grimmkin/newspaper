â€œI want to confirm to you that the Owerri Operations office on behalf of the Director General of NEMA, Mohammed Mohammed, has concluded distribution of the relief items to victims of landslide and flood in Abia.

The governor said the palliatives were only a show of empathy for the people as more sustainable initiatives were being implemented in phases.
The Abia State governor, Alex Otti, has commenced the distribution of palliatives to cushion the impact of the fuel subsidy removal in the state.
At least 3,000 bags of rice (50 kg) were said to have been shared in the first phase to political wards in the state, while the state has commenced distribution of the 12,600 bags received in the second phase.
During the flag-off event in Micheal Okwara Auditorium in Umuahia, the state capital, Otti said the food relief packages were meant for the poorest of the poor in order to mitigate the effects of the economic hardship on them and no government appointees should receive one grain.
