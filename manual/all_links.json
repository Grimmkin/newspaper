the exchange rate.\nThese savings will complement the efforts of the Infrastructure Support Fund (ISF) and other existing and planned fiscal measures, all aimed at ensuring that the subsidy removal translates into tangible improvements in the lives and living standards of Nigerians.\nThe Committee commends President Tinubu for the bold decision to remove the petrol subsidy, and even more

instance, removing fuel subsidy is the right thing to do because we all know that fuel subsidy is a fraud, but the repercussions of the removal need to be cushioned.\nWhat then are those things that

the Acting Comptroller-General of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Adewale Adeniyi said there were still cases of smuggling of petrol at some border stations despite the subsidy removal and rising price of petrol in Nigeria.\nDue to the subsidy, the price of petrol in Nigeria was lower than in neighbouring countries, which created an arbitrage opportunity for some traders to buy petrol in Nigeria and sell it in those countries at a higher price.\nThe fact that fuel is still being smuggled therefore thus elicits some questions: Has Nigeria actually removed subsidy on fuel being imported

by the removal are serious and legitimate public interests.\u201d\u201cThe Tinubu government has a legal obligation to protect individuals against the threat posed to human rights by the removal of subsidy on petrol, and to effectively address the aftermath of subsidy removal.\u201d\u201cUnless the government is compelled and directed to publish the spending details of the savings from the removal of subsidy on petrol, the removal will continue to undermine the rights of Nigerians, and increase their vulnerability to poverty.\u201d\u201cThe implementation of the National Social Safety Net Programme (NASSP) and spending on the programme have been mostly shrouded in secrecy.\u201d\u201cPublishing the details of the spending of the N400bn and other savings from the removal of subsidy would also ensure that persons with public responsibilities are answerable to the people for the performance of their duties.\u201d\u201cTransparency and accountability in the spending details of the N400bn saved as a result of the removal of subsidy on petrol, and on the spending of subsequent savings from the removal would mean that the savings can help poor Nigerians to overcome the effects of such removal.\u201d\u201cIt would also help to avoid a morally repugnant result of double jeopardy on poor and socially and economically vulnerable Nigerians.\u201d\u201cThe lack of transparency and accountability in the spending of savings from the removal of subsidy on petrol and the resulting human costs would directly threaten fundamental human rights that the government has an obligation to

direst consequences that the removal may reap on human rights, especially given the disproportionate impact on these Nigerians.\u201d\u201cThe removal of subsidy on petrol continues to negatively and
